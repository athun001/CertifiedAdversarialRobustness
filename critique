Critique for each paper must have the following fields:

Summary of the paper (a paragraph)
Contributions (typically 2-3 bullets for each paper)
Strengths and weaknesses (2-3 bullets for each)
Your opinions (on the strengths and weaknesses)
Please make your best effort to write concise and precise statements. For example:

In the summary, it is better to write statements that are more summarizing than descriptive. A common mistake is to write "this paper proposed a methodology..." This isn't valuable for you later on; you can write "the key idea (or intuition) of this paper is XYZ."
Contributions / strengths / weaknesses. You need to extract the essence---what the authors really want us to remember about the paper. For example, the fact that the research is well-evaluated is not a contribution; it's necessary for the authors to convey their ideas. Similarly, bad writing is not a weakness for those selected papers. You can mention them in the "opinions" field.
